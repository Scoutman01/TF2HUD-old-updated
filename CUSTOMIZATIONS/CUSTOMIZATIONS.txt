/////////// MINOR CUSTOMIZATIONS ////////////

Vignette overlay image - change visibility value of "Vignette" (16:9) or "Vignette2" (4:3) in hudlayout.res
Disable server/map text - uncomment xpos and ypos value of "HudMessage" in hudlayout.res

"Disable server/map text" affects some plugins like Versus Saxton Hale from displaying boss health, or custom maps that show text to the player. Don't use this customization if you plan on needing this information. If you play vanilla TF2, you should be OK to use this customization.

///////////////// MULTIPLE CUSTOMIZATIONS //////////////////

If two or more customizations use the same file, and you want to use them, you'll have to merge them yourself. For example, the hitmarker and crosshair customizations use the same file. I added comments to these files to help you edit and configure it yourself.

//////////////////////// COLORS ///////////////////////////

1) Open clientscheme.res in the resource\ folder with a text editor.
2) Scroll down a little until you see "Overheal" and "Damaged" under the COLORS section.

These affect the colors of the tournament spectator hud, buffed and low HP respectively.

3) Edit the values after "Overheal" or "Damaged" with a valid RGBA value (Red Green Blue Alpha). Remember to keep the quotes.

For example, "255 0 0 255" is pure red that is fully opaque. "0 255 0 0" is pure green that is fully transparent.

4) Save the file, and restart TF2 to see your new colors.
